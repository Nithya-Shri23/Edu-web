            <p>Web mockups must be created by a professional graphic and web designer, in other words, a web designer. Venturing into the creation of model by yourself can be long and quite perilous. Moreover, to create a captivating and intuitive website for the Internet user, it is necessary to know some notions of ergonomics.
</p>

<div class="sitemockup">
        <h1>1. What is a web site mockup?</h1>
        <p class="p1">A website mockup is the result of several steps of creation to provide a graphic representation of the layout of a website. In fine, the web model will represent what the future website will look like with :</p>
    <ul class="point">
        <li>Its colors</li>
        <li>Its blocks</li>
        <li>Its menu</li>
        <li>Its buttons</li>
        <li>Its logo</li>
        <li>Its illustrations or images</li>
        </ul>
    </div> 
    <div class="vl">
        <p class="vertical">The model is simply the step before the development of the website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="con-mockup">
        <p>For some people, who know what they want on their website, this step of creating a model will seem unnecessary. But they are wrong! Mock-ups allow you to structure your ideas, to establish an intelligent site architecture and finally to test the layout. It is not once on the CMS or with the developer that we must test to move or change blocks and elements just to "see what it gives". That's what mockups are for.<br>
<br>
            As mentioned above, it may seem smart to eliminate this mock-up creation step to save both production time and money. But believe me, it's not. You have to know how to lose time to save time. When we make the specifications of a website, it must include this part "model" with at least the wireframes! It is also necessary to think of allocating time for that, because the conception of models can take several weeks, according to the site to be made.</p>

        <h1>2. The steps to create a website model ?</h1>
        <p class="step-para">2.1 Starting from a blank page, obsolete or important?
            Personally, I'm a paper and pencil lover, strange for a web designer? Well, no! I always start a creation, a model or an illustration with sketches.<br>
            
            Regarding the creation of a model, on paper, we can already make the wireframe or zoning. This allows you to sort out and put your ideas in place at a lower cost.<br>
            
            But be careful, this paper step just allows to make some sketches! To make a professional model, it is important to move quickly enough on a design software. And if you wonder why, it's simply for the sharing of the document and for its evolution. On paper you are quickly restricted whereas on a software you can create many pages and different lengths. It's also important to have a clear and readable mock-up to share with a developer or a client so that they understand what you've done.</p><br>
    <p class="step-para">The wireframe or functional model
        Also called zoning, the wireframe will schematize the structure of a website.<br> The idea is to place geometric shapes to represent blocks, texts and images. All this to show the main areas of content and interaction of the site. It is at this point that you have to think about ergonomics and design the site as simply as possible so that the user can find the information quickly and easily.</p>
   <br>     
        <div class="v3">
            <p class="vertical3">By the way, this is another point that makes you need to go<br> through a professional to make your mock-ups.

            <img src="asset/wireframe.jpg" class="wireframe"><br>
            <p class="step-para">The prototype or graphic model<br><br>
                Contrary to the wireframe, the graphic model will be more advanced and more precise. Here, each part of the site will be detailed, each functionality will be designated and the graphic elements of the website will be included. On the graphic model, we also find the text content, the colors, the logo and the right typography.<br>
                <br>
                It is at this moment that we realize if the ideas we had in mind are feasible on the web and, if they are not, we must rethink them.<br>
                
                To help you create the graphic model, it is interesting to make an inspiration board with the different styles of website or illustration that we like.</p>

    <h1>3. How to design a website mock-up?</h1>
    <ul class="tip">
        <li>STUDY THE COMPETITION :<br>
            Look at what your competitors are doing and get inspired by their website and their communication strategy.
            
            Be careful, I said "inspire you"! It is not a question of copying and pasting your competitor's website. You will not get any satisfaction from it and you will not have any credibility with your customers.</li>
        <li>LISTINGS :<BR>
            List the elements you want to appear on the website and the pages that will constitute it.</li>
        <li>MENU DESIGN :<BR>
            Start with the top of the website, the menu or header. Start with a simple menu for the moment, don't waste time looking for what to put there. You'll see, once your whole website is flattened, the menu will build itself.</li>
        <li>PAGE CONTENT :<BR>
            Next, move on to the content of the page you are creating. Follow traditional layouts and use a grid to keep your elements aligned and within the main layout of the site.
            
            You see it on all sites, this is the area where the elements of a page will be displayed. For example, on websites, you can see that text and images do not go from one edge to another. There is a blank area on the sides.</li>
        <li>BOTTOM OF THE PAGE :<BR>
            Once the structure of your page is done by indicating the location of the elements, you arrive at the bottom of the page and thus the footer. In the footer we put links to pages of the site less important than those in the header. For example, the legal notices.</li>

    <p class="que4"style="background-color:#001A33;">Use too many colors
        A website must certainly be dynamic, attractive, design, modern, etc. <br>But it must above all convey a message! And too many colors will disturb the eye of the Internet user.<br> The site will therefore appear overloaded and, in the end, no information will be retained by the user.</p>

      <h1>FORGETTING TO WORK WITH A GRID </h1>

        <h1>FORGOT TO HIGHLIGHT THE BUTTON</h1>
